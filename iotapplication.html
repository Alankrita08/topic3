    <h1 > My Introduction </h1>
    <p> Hey..! My name is Alankrita. I'm from Kurukshetra, Haryana. I am a second year student at Chitkara University studying Software Enginnering and want to have a good career in the field of computers. I learnt many new things in the previous semesters which is sure going to help me in th future.  </p>
    <p>I have already completed 11 units for this course. These were SEB101 Engineering physics, SIT192 Discrete Mathematics, SIT102 Introduction to Programming, SIT111 Algorithms and Computing Systems, SIT217 Software Engiineering 1: Robotics Project, SIT123 Data Capture Technpologies, SIT232 Object-Oriented Development, SIT103 Data and Information Management, SEJ101 Design Fundamentals, SIT221 Data Structures and Algorithms and SIT210 Embedded Systems Development. </p>
    <p>These units taught me many new things and some recapitulation of old concepts. I learnt many new programming languages like C++, C#, Python and Python. I also got to know about the Arduino programming and got a chance to have a hands on experience on hardware parts. I along with my team built a robot. AutoCAD designing was a main element for the learning of the course. I worked on several projects to complete the unit's requirement.</p>
    <p>This unit SIT209 Software Engineering2: Developing Internet-of-Things Applications mainly focuses on building IoT applications usig web technologies. At the end of the unit, I expect myself to build a great project on IoT applications and learn new programming languages to build the interactive web pages.</p>
    <h1> Summary of Activities </h1>
    <h2> ACTIVITY 1: </h2>
    <p>In this activity, my knowledge about IoT applications enhanced. This activity included some questions that had to be answered in a group. While doing this activity, I learnt that IoT applications are the applications that integrate hardware and software and are connected with internet to transmit data. The main fetaures that an IoT application should have are scalability, accessibility, connectivity and a good communication between the devices and the application. There are alot of examples of IOT applications and some of them are smart watch, smart cars, smart home applications like smart lighting system, smart air conditioning system and smart tracking systems.</p>
    <h2> ACTIVITY 2: </h2>
    <p>In this activity, I learnt how something can be made smart using Internet of Things. This activity included some questions that had to be answered in a group for the scenario of the smart building. While doing this activity, I learnt that smart means to make something efficient using technology to ease the work. A smart building should have sensors, actuators and buttons to sense the environment and do the things accordingly. A smart building should be economically efficient, highly secure and should use appropriate use of resources. Some of the smart building scenarios include automated lighing system so that less energy to be consumed, automated temperature maintaining system, high level security system using different kinds of sensors. ALl these systems make the environment smart.</p>
    <h2> ACTIVITY 3: </h2>
    <p>In this activity, I learnt the importance and use of control interface required for any Iot application. This activity included some questions that had to be answered in a group. While doing this activity, my knowledge about the high level features like accessibility of the data globally, high connectivity to process the data, monitoring activities a good control interface should  have. Several parts are needed for a control interface and that are good user interface, internet, data base for storage of data and a good physical control interface. Someome who is involved in the process of using the control interface is a user of that interface. The providers and the customers who usethe application are the users.</p>
